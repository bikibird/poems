# The Story So Far

Captain Neat-o floats in space,  
So helpless and out of place.  

His situation is dire...  
Suddenly there's ray gun fire!  

Freeze! Shrink! Mimeo! and Drop!  
Doctor Lamento wont stop...  

Pawn Neat-o battles his clones!  
"Too formidable!" he groans.  

"Then I will give you teammates.  
Strategize while fate awaits...  

I act with hostility!  
Engage the utility!"  

Honest Neat-o, head crowned gold,  
Propels toward home. Behold...  

Hero, his green band flashing,  
Cuts a figure so dashing.  

Lektrik electrickery!  
Oh, what wicked wickery!
