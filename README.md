This poem is a rewrite of a poem that my Grandma Ruth wrote for me.

# Earl The Squirrel Revisited

Earl, the squirrel, was deep in thought,
Thinking of things he hadn't got.
A nut, a friend, and bright red wings,
An angry heart pined o'er these things.
  Such was his quarrel,
  The negative churl!

Then a young lass ventured from home,
From icy north, where badgers roam--
Friend with peanuts, peanuts galore!
When Earl ate them, she gave him more.
  But wings, poor Jenny,
  She hadn't any!
  
Was Earl still angry? Did he pout?
Well, not long, reasoning, no doubt:
No peanuts, no revels, no sense.
Hungry creatures take no offense.
  Said Earl, the squirrel,
  You're quite a nice girl.
  
 # Earl the Squirrel (Original Version)

Earl, the squirrel, was deep in thought,
Considering things that he hadn't got;
A peanut, a friend and bright red wings,
These were some of the various things;
  This Earl, the squirrel,
  A negative churl!
Then came a young lady, far from home,
From the icy north, where badgers roam.
A true little firend, with peanuts galore;
When Earl ate them, she gave him more.
  But the wings, poor Jenny,
  She didn't have any!
Was Earl angry and did he pout?
Well, not for long, for to do without
His peanuts wouldn't have made much sense.
A hungry squirrel takes no offense.
  Says Earl, the squirrel.
  "That's quite a nice girl!"
