# Earl The Squirrel

Earl, the squirrel, was deep in thought,
Thinking of things he hadn't got.
A nut, a friend, and bright red wings,
An angry heart pined o'er these things.
  Such was his quarrel,
  The negative churl!

Then a young lass ventured from home,
From icy north, where badgers roam--
A friend holding peanuts galore!
When Earl ate them, she gave him more.
  But wings, poor Jenny,
  She hadn't any!
  
Was Earl still angry? Did he pout?
Well, not long, reasoning no doubt:
No peanuts, no revels: no sense;
Hungry creature, take not offense!
  Says Earl, the squirrel,
  You're quite a nice girl.
