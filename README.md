# Earl The Squirrel

Earl, the squirrel, was deep in thought,
Considering things that he hadn't got.
A peanut, a friend, and bright red wings,
These were some of the various things.
  This Earl, the squirrel,
  A negative churl!

Then came a young lady, far from home,
From the icy north, where badgers roam.
A true little friend, with peanuts galore;
When Earl ate them, she gave him more.
  But the wings, poor Jenny,
  She didn't have any!
  
Was Earl angry and did he pout?
Well, not for long, reasoning no doubt:
No peanuts, no revels: no sense!
A hungry squirrel takes no offense.
  Says Earl, the squirrel,
  You're quite a nice girl!
