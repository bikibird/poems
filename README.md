# Earl The Squirrel

Earl, the squirrel, was deep in thought,
Thinking of things he hadn't got.
A nut, a friend, and bright red wings,
These were some of the various things.
  This Earl, the squirrel,
  A negative churl!

Then came a young girl, far from home,
From icy north, where badgers roam--
A sweet friend, with peanuts galore;
When Earl ate them, she gave him more.
  But wings, poor Jenny,
  She had not any!
  
Was Earl angry and did he pout?
Well, not long, reasoning no doubt:
No peanuts, no revels: no sense;
Hungry creature, take not offense.
  Says Earl, the squirrel,
  You're quite a nice girl!
